This repository contains source code for a new project, mise-en-ab√Æme, an investigation into and collection of, creative extensions of self-replicating code -- programs whose output is their source. 


The project is primarily inspired by Ken Thompson\'s 1984 Turing Award Lecture 'Reflections on Trusting Trust' and the essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" by Walter Benjamin, as well as myriad other creators, who will be referenced in the near future as additional materials are added to this repository and associated project.
